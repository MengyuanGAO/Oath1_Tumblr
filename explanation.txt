Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.

I am accessing the Tumblr search API and gathering:

- 20 posts for each of 2 blogs I'm going to search for

- For each post, I'll be accessing the title, note_account, summary, tags, post date and the short URL of the post
    
- I'll write 2 CSV files, one for each blogâ€™s posts 

- Data in each CSV file: 6 columns -- title, note_account, summary, tags, date of post, and url of the post

- URL for the API: https://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/{blog-identifier}/posts

- If necessary, URL describing the authentication process for the API: https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#auth
